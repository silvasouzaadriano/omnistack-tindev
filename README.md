    TINDEV - Omnistack #8 | Rocketseat
</h1>

<h4 align="center">
 Development of an application using the stack *Node.js*, *ReactJS* e *React Native*
 
## Concepts
 - The application created its similar to Tinder, however, for developers;
 - A developer must be added using Github user;
 - The information resulted from Githib API is used to be saved in database;
 - Its possible to give like and dislike for users;

 - Due to **Node** architecture, by using a **websocket**, will be done a communication between server (API) and frontend in real time; It means that when an user give a like to another, and the same user which reiceved the like also give the like to other user (despite of frontend or mobile), in real time will be appear on screen the match information.
